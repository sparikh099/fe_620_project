# FE 620 Pricing Asian Options for US Brent Crude Oil Futures
Authors: Shyam Parikh, Matthew Thomas, Shubh Joshi, and Karen Gong

We researched the valuation of average-price Asian options. For our experiment, we gathered data from Brent Crude Oil Futures(BZ=F). In conducting our experiment, we started with trying to model Asian options using Binomial tree Methods, 
however, that proved to be inefficient. Then, we shifted to implementing Monte-Carlo Methods and validating them through 
methods described in the Vadim Linetsky paper for arithmetically-averaged options. We subsequently adapted the method to price geometrically-averaged options.  From there, we worked on hedging analysis using both regular delta hedging for the arithmetically averaged options, and then dynamic delta gedging for the geometrically-averaged options.
